## Instruction

### Environment Setup

Please follow the instructions in [Environment_Setup.md](Environment_Setup.md) to install Git, prepare a compiler, install xmake, and set up your IDE. After the setup, you should be able to run `xmake run test` and see a colorful triangle.

If you encounter any problems during the setup, please read the [xmake FAQ](Environment_Setup.md#xmake-faq) first, or contact the TA (litzzzhang@connect.hku.hk) for help.

### Assignments

All assignments share the same codebase and build system:

- Assignment 1: [Interactive Triangle Drawing and 3D Scene Editor](Assignment1/README.md)
- Assignment 2: TBA
- Assignment 3: TBA

Each assignment has its own folder containing a `README.md` with the handout and an `xmake.lua` with its build target. To compile and run an assignment, enter the `COMP3271` directory and run:

```shell
xmake run <target_name>
```

Replace `<target_name>` with the target of the assignment (e.g., `assignment1` for Assignment 1), and follow the instructions in the corresponding `README.md`.

Any commit and issue will be welcome. Don't hesitate to seek help via email.
